# LearnBSL
This is a program which can be trained to teach the user how to perform sign language signs.

The program would suggest a word to the user to practice, and they would be shown instructions about how it should be carried out. Continuous video of the user’s hand signs through the webcam would be captured and processed to ascertain whether they were being performed correctly. By using the information captured to identify the relative positions of the user’s fingers, it can then be deduced whether the word has been correctly represented or not. If not, then the user would have to redo the gesture until it has been deemed correct. The recognition process would be done through the use of an AI model, which would first need to be trained on the words being recognised.
